What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manually choosing when to create a commit allows commits whenever there is a logical change and avoids unnecessary commits. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It stores previous versions of the code, therefore you can easily revert to them if needed.
